# Hello-world 👏
## 📖About the project
In this project, I set up a "Hello world" repository. The porpuse of this project is to master all of the tools and best practices I learned about in previous Microverse activities. I'll be using them in all Microverse projects and most likely in my future job as well, so it is important to know them!
